If ball will collide with wall, dont draw, instead calc next step and draw that

Segfault will occur if set up gpio too many times (maybe initialize it once)

tile must be 32x32
use a combination of the tiles to make bricks
ball shouldnt be too hard to track with eyes on screen

for controller have a global function to initialize SNES
		a get button so we can get the input of the controller
